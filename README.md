# _THE GATES OF SHELL_

## What is a Shell?
 A shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard
and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days,
it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such
as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in
addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

## What does this Shell do?
This Shell can:
- Handle errors and the end of file.
- Print error messages when a executable can't be found.
- Display a prompt when its waiting for a command and after
recieving a command.

## What you need to compile it?
To compile this Shell, you'll need this:
> gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
